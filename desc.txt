There will be a python server listening on pserver.

Developer will transport a build over, .zip or .msi (.zip initially)
they will then connect, and send the filename over.
this will be stored in memory (or a persistent text-file?)

user clients will query the server for the current build, or a
specific build number.
the specified build will be transferred over, and unzipped.
folder: 
pharmaci/update.exe
pharmaci/current/ <-- the build

eventually, use pysync for rsync-like syncing.

py2exe for packaging
